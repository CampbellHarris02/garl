# GARL (Genetic Algorithm Reinforcement Learning)

A study into how Genetic Algorithms are used for efficient search of reinforcement learning spaces.


Genetic Algorithms are good for searching spaces with memory. 
Area's with productive qualities will allow the genes to evolve into those productive spaces whereas unproductive spaces are forgotten. 
 - what about highly isolated productive spaces? 
 - there must be a way to cross unproductive spaces in search for more productive spaces. 

In the first iteration I chose a snake game, but will continue the study with EvoGym
